# Bibliotech Library App

Library is a web app that allows users to create an account and add book information for their personal libraries. I created it from scratch as a project/demo application.

Some interesting features:

* Served with Express
* Pages are generated by Handelbars
* Uses a MySQL backend
* Uses passport-local for session authentication

**Status**: This project is currently in development.
